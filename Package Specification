Package Specification :

-The specification is the interface to the package. 
-It just DECLARES the types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms that can be referenced from outside the package.
-In other words, it contains all information about the content of the package, but excludes the code for the subprograms.
-All objects placed in the specification are called public objects.
-Any subprogram not in the package specification but coded in the package body is called a private object.
