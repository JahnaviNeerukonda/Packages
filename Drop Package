DROP PACKAGE :
  The DROP PACKAGE statement drops a stored package from the database.
  This statement drops the body and specification of a package.
  
 -To drop a package, you use the DROP PACKAGE statement with the following syntax:
           DROP PACKAGE [BODY] schema_name.package_name;
           
  
-If you want to drop only the body of the package, you need to specify the BODY keyword.
 If you omit the BODY keyword, then the statement drops both the body and specification of the package.
 
 ex: DROP PACKAGE BODY b1;
